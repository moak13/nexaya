Question: Did you use any standard architecture, if yes state the architecture,
and reason for your choice?

Answer: Yes I used a some what standard architecture. The name of the architecture the project uses is called, 
Stacked architecture.
This architecture is built on top of a very popularly known architecture called MVVM.
The reason for choosing Stacked is very simple, it enforces rules to adhere too that makes codebase:
1. Scalable
2. Maintainable
3. Testable

When others are still thinking of how to architect, with stacked, we are way pass that and already delivering.
